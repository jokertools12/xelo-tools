# Achievement Sound Files

This directory holds sound files used by the achievement notification system.

## Required Sound Files

The system expects the following sound files:

1. `achievement-default.mp3` - The default sound played when any achievement is unlocked
2. `achievement-rare.mp3` - Special sound for rare/valuable achievements (optional)
3. `achievement-milestone.mp3` - Sound for milestone achievements (optional)

## How to Add Sound Files

You can replace these placeholder files with actual MP3 files of your choice. 
The sounds should be short celebration sounds (1-3 seconds) that convey accomplishment.

Free sounds can be found on sites like:
